Bitcoin price prediction with Python" where i implement time-series using Random Walk as a base model and An Autoregressive Forecaster (ForecasterAutoreg) with a LightGBM regressor to compare both models. Also, taking into account Bitcoin halving which is a programmed event and is part of the design and operation of some cryptocurrencies where the miners validate the transaction blocks of the network, in this case, Bitcoin, and each time they succeed, they receive an amount of that digital currency.
